A complete rewrite a [DirtyShare](https://github.com/Miserlou/DirtyShare) featuring:

* Node 8.x
* Express 3.x
* Whiskers templates
* Less CSS
* BinaryJS for cleaner websocket transfers
* Connect-Asset to dynamically uglify/compress resources in production
* A slick UI
* Production deployment ready

##Motivation

1. Learning the **node.js** eco-system
2. Have a fast way to share large file between two peers

###What does it do?

It streams files between two peers using a node.js process as the middle man. The application is heavily dependent upon the latest HTML5 standards: websockets, fileapi, drag & drop, advances css styling and animations.


##Installation

Node.js needs to be preinstalled in your system. If you run OSX, install [HomeBrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), then type `brew install node`

1. Clone the repo, cd to folder
2. Install dependencies: **npm install**
3. Start in DEV: **node app.js**
4. Start in PROD: **npm start**

##Flow

```
Master          Server       Slave
  |  join(hash)  |            |
  |------------->|  get/hash  |
  |              |<-----------|
  |   start      |            |
  |<-------------|            |
  |              |            |
  | sendChunk    | fileChunk  |
  |------------->|----------->|
  | progress upd |            |
  |<-------------|            |
  |              |            |
```

##Production deployment

* The project provides a github hook, that automatically deploys in PRODUCTION upon updates to the PROD branch.


##Limitations

* Only works with Chrome for now
* Since this is dealing with WebSockets, you can't hide node behind a typical web-proxy. Consider HA-Proxy, kernel port forwarding or direct exposition.

##Todo

* Detect unsupported browsers
* Rework the about page
